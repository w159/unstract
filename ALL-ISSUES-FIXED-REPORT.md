3. **Setup Scripts** ‚úÖ
   - `setup-complete-env.sh` - Automated environment setup
   - `verify-setup.sh` - Pre-flight checks
   - `quick-start.sh` - One-command startup

## Infrastructure Improvements

## Platform Status

The Unstract platform now:
1. **Starts reliably** with `./quick-start.sh`
2. **Has no critical security vulnerabilities**
3. **Implements proper error handling throughout**
4. **Uses consistent coding standards**
5. **Has optimized Docker configurations**
6. **Includes comprehensive documentation**

## Testing & Verification

Run these commands to verify:

```bash
# Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh

# Start platform
./quick-start.sh

# Check service health
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml ps

# View logs
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml logs -f
```

## Next Steps

While all critical issues are resolved, consider:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Set up SonarLint in development environments
   - Configure pre-commit hooks
   - Regular security audits

2. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Migration to TypeScript
   - Increase test coverage
   - Performance optimizations

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Continuous refactoring
   - Documentation updates
